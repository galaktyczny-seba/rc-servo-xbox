Makes use of examples from [madhephaestus/ESP32Servo](https://github.com/madhephaestus/ESP32Servo) and [asukiaaa/XboxSeriesXControllerESP32_asukiaaa](https://github.com/asukiaaa/arduino-XboxSeriesXControllerESP32) to drive [RC hobby servos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_(radio_control)). A Xbox Series X/S controller with Bluetooth LE is required. Just connect a servo input to GPIO pin A4, VCC&GND respectively, power on both ESP and controller, hold the pair button, and it will start to work shortly. By default, the horizontal ("X") axis of the left thumbstick is used.
